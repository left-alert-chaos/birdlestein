# Birdlestein text editor
**Warning: Birdlestein is still a work in progess!**

Birdlestein is a blazingly slow, simple text editor implemented entirely in Rust. Currently all it can do is open and edit files, but it's always improving. More to come soon, I hope.

# To run
To run Birdlestein, you use Cargo. Directions:

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Navigate to the repo's directory in your terminal.
3. Type `cargo run --release`.

The build is updated after every commit, so it shouldn't have to compile (assuming you're on Linux :)). If you have to compile, it takes 5 to 30 seconds.

# On artificial intelligence
One of the great things about simple editors like Birdlestein is that there's no bloat. I consider AI to be bloat. Contrary to its name, AI is big, slow, and inaccurate. Despite that, it's shoved into every nook and cranny of almost every software out there. Microsoft Word has multiple Copilot buttons. There are too many "AI-forward", "agentic", "future-oriented" tools out there. Birdlestein is proud to be a non-member of that group. Birdlestein will never have a Copilot side panel. It will never try to rewrite your functions. It will never wipe your boot drive and ask for forgiveness. It is an editor, not a vibe coding tool.
